# Koishiemacs
##### *pronounced "koishi-macs"*
---

This is just my emacs configuration file. At its core, it's only really meant for me to sync my config across places with relative ease.

My mindset when tinkering about and finding out was that I wanted something that didn't interrupt my windows habits, while keeping all of Emacs' goodies. Tested on Emacs 30.0.

Some settings are bound to change, since I still haven't used the editor long enough.

## Main ~~features~~ differences

- Cua mode
- Native Emacs tabs
- LSP
- Autostart at 160x50
- Separate custom.el

## Features borrowed from [Witchmacs](https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs)

- company's :config
- switch-window's :config
- ido + vertical-mode
- rebinds for `C-x 2` and `C-x 3`
- tabbing, and nearly all minor QoL changes
